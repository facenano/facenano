I previously had a number of years working experiences in multiple areas, about internet network, DNS&Domain, Design&Director. Currently, I am keen on travelling around the world and "discovery", "exploration", "comprehend", "perceive". If you have some audacious thoughts, please let me know too.

Make it possible and make it happen!

Traveled countries: China, Russia, Nepal, India, Pakistan, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, Myanmar, Bangladesh, Iran, Afghanistan, Armenia, UAE,... etc.
